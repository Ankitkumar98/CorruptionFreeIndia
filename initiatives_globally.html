        <h3>
          There are many regional and global initiatives that have been taken to
          prevent Corruption globally and regionally. Some of them are mentioned
          below.

                1. The cost of corruption to society is enormous. In its 2017
                report, Global Financial Integrity estimates that illicit
                financial flows (IFFs) in 2014 alone ranged from US$1.4 trillion
                to $2.5 trillion. The World Economic Forum estimates that the
                cost of corruption today equals more than 5 percent of global
                GDP ($2.6 trillion).
              </li>
              <li>
                2. These figures are staggering but even more staggering is what
                lies behind these financial calculations – a world of dire
                poverty and inequality that continues to be exacerbated by the
                distortions in income distribution and public expenditure
                decisions, which are influenced by corrupt practices.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. The Panama and Paradise Papers revealed the magnitude of
                hidden wealth from all over the world in offshore jurisdictions.
                According to Oxfam International, tax evasion causes Africa
                alone to lose $14 billion a year in fiscal revenues. These lost
                budgetary resources could have paid for healthcare to save the
                lives of 4 million children and could have employed more
                teachers to get every African child into school. Similarly, the
                2017 Global Corruption Barometer on the Asia-Pacific region
                shows that out of 22,000 people surveyed, 38 percent of the
                poorest said they had to pay a bribe to get access to public
                services. And data from 42 countries compiled by Transparency
                International reveal that higher levels of bribe-paying are
                associated with lower literacy rates among young people.

                1. On 22-23 August 2017, the United Nations Development
                Programme (UNDP)’s Anti-Corruption for Peaceful and Inclusive
                Societies in Asia-Pacific 2016-2020 (ACPIS) Project gathered in
                Manila, Philippines national country researchers, together with
                regional and global experts, to plan a new UNDP research report
                on the ‘Linkages between Corruption and Violent Extremism in the
                Asia-Pacific Region’.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Ms Clare Duffield, Counsellor, Australian Embassy in the
                Philippines, Mr Ola Almgren, UNDP Resident Representative in the
                Philippines, and Mr Phil Matsheza, Team Leader of the Governance
                and Peacebuilding Unit in UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub opened the
                workshop and welcomed participants. The activity is supported by
                Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Ms Duffield discussed the ‘dual scourge’ of corruption and
                violent extremism harming national and local stability and
                prosperity. Mr Almgren noted the importance of involving youth
                and women to increase the effectiveness of fighting corruption
                and preventing violent extremism. Mr Matsheza highlighted the
                strong demand that now exists for generating evidence of the
                linkages between corruption and violent extremism.
              </li>

                4. The national researchers from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan
                Philippines and Thailand will start their country studies after
                the workshop. UNDP aims to launch the new report to mark

            <ul>
              <li>
                1. Two-and-a-half years ago, one of the core demands of the
                Euro-Maidan protests was curbing corruption. In 2014, the new
                reform government chose the fight against corruption as one of
                its strategic priorities. At that pivotal moment, UNDP was
                honoured and proud to stand by Ukraine’s drivers of reform.
                Globally, in all the 140 or more countries where the United
                Nations Development Programme has its presence, we are working
                hand in hand with governments to help them solve issues and
                challenges that lead to effective democratic governance.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. This time with the backing of the Government of Denmark, UNDP
                in Ukraine was able to render expert advice and financial
                assistance to help implement the reforms that were being charted
                out. A new Anti-Corruption Strategy was adopted an enshrined in
                legislation that included the creation of a number of new
                institutions and mechanisms. Among the new anti-corruption tools
                UNDP was asked to help nurture, was the electronic asset
                declaration system.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. The ambition of Ukrainian legislators at the time was to
                achieve a qualitative difference to earlier, largely ineffective
                anti-corruption tools and institutions. For such instruments to
                enjoy the trust and confidence of the wider public, they would
                have to significantly advance from earlier attempts that had
                been found to contain numerous loopholes and were largely
                considered ineffective.

              <u
                >Liability of legal persons and foreign bribery laws needed to
                fight corruption in Southeast Asia</u
              >
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                1. Legal persons dominate today’s global economy. Large
                multinationals engaged in transportation, construction,
                telecommunication, mining, energy, chemicals, and many other
                sectors have a huge share of global business activities. This
                puts them at risk of getting involved in high-level corruption
                cases. Perhaps not surprisingly, many of the biggest corruption
                investigations today concern legal persons rather than natural
                persons. For example, China fined GlaxoSmithKline, the UK’s
                biggest pharmaceutical firm, $490 million after finding it
                guilty of bribery. The U.S. Department of Justice imposed nearly
                $220 million in fines on Japanese company JGC for bribing
                Nigerian officials to secure development contracts for liquefied
                natural gas facilities. More recently, government agents raided
                the headquarters of Lotte group¬-among the largest conglomerates
                in South Korea-as part of a corruption probe. One of the highest
                fines ever imposed occurred to Alstom S.A., a French power and
                transportation company, sentenced to $772,29 million. Overall,
                Alstom paid more than $75 million in secret bribes to government
                officials in several countries, such as Indonesia and Taiwan.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Criminal prosecution has an important deterrent effect on
                corruption. However, punishing only natural persons in cases
                that directly involve corporations might not be enough. We need
                to establish clearly the liability of legal persons for
                corruption offences in order to deter corporations willing to
                break the rules. This is easier said than done. Many countries
                today remain reluctant to impose criminal liability on legal
                persons because of a strict adherence to the traditional maxim
                that requires moral culpability for the commission of criminal
                offences.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Article 26 of the United Nations Convention Against
                Corruption (UNCAC) establishes the liability of legal persons as
                a mandatory provision. At the end of 2015, ten of the eleven
                countries in the Southeast Asian region had completed or were
                concluding their first cycle review (Chapter III and IV) of the
                UNCAC, which included Article 26. The review found that most
                Southeast Asian countries do not sufficiently cover the
                requirements of UNCAC Article 26. Even in countries where the
                appropriate legislation is in place, there have been only few
                prosecutions and convictions of legal persons for corruption
                offences.
              </li>
              <li>
                4. In addition, eight of the ten Southeast Asian countries that
                have completed their first cycle review do not have specific
                legislation explicitly addressing the issue of active bribery of
                foreign public officials and officials of public international
                organizations, as required by UNCAC Article 16, Paragraph 1.
                Foreign bribery is an act involving a foreign national providing
                or offering a benefit to another person from a different
                country, or causing a benefit to be provided or offered to
                another person from a different country, where the benefit is
                not legitimately due. This issue is very relevant given the high
                degree of economic development and integration among the
                countries in the region.

Team project for <b>Code Against Corruption Hackathon</b>.

<h3><a href="#">Theme</a></h3>
Build awareness and an easily accessible tool that educates users about various anti-corruption laws and regulations. This forum should act as a content curator platform that displays anti-corruption initiatives (globally and regionally), citizensâ€™ rights on reporting incidences of petty/grand corruption, and ways to hold authorities accountable for such acts.

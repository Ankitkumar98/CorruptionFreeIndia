        <h1><u>Anti-Corruption Initiatives in India</u></h1>
        <h3>
          How can poor people fight corruption? Contemporary ‘good governance’
          policies of development agencies stress the relationship between an
          open official information regime – particularly transparency in
          official development expenditure accounts – and government
          accountability. However, many governments are very secretive and to
          obtain information demands resources that socially marginalised groups
          often simply do not have: organisational strength to stand up to local
          elites, access to official information, technical skills to analyse
          accounts, and legal resources to prosecute violations.

            <ul>
              <li>
                1. The Act states that an offence of money laundering has been
                committed if a person is a party to any process connected with
                the proceeds of crime and projects such proceeds as untainted
                property. “Proceeds of crime” means any property obtained by a
                person as a result of criminal activity related to certain
                offences listed in the schedule to the Act. A person can be
                charged with the offence of money laundering only if he has been
                charged with committing a scheduled offence.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. The penalty for committing the offence of money laundering is
                rigorous imprisonment for three to seven years and a fine of
                upto Rs 5 lakh. If a person is convicted of an offence under the
                Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 the term
                of imprisonment can extend upto 10 years.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. The Adjudicating Authority, appointed by the central
                government, shall decide whether any of the property attached or
                seized is involved in money laundering. An Appellate Tribunal
                shall hear appeals against the orders of the Adjudicating
                Authority and any other authority under the Act.

            <ul>
              <li>
                1. The Foreign Contribution Reglation Act, 2010 (FCRA) prohibits

                employees of bodies owned or controlled by the government,
                except with the permissions of the central government. The FCRA
                defines the term "foreign source" to include any foreign
                citizen, company, entity, multinational corporation, trust or
                foundation. Further, non-governmental organisations (including
                charities) receiving contributions from a 'foreign source' are
                required to be registered under the FCRA, and report such
                contibutions. The FCRA provides for an exception for personal
                gifts valued up to INR 25,000 (approximately US$ 375), and such
                gifts are not prohibited.

                2. In addition to the requirement of obtaining the central
                government's consent or registration for the purpose of
                receiving contributions from a foreign source, the FCRA provides
                for suspension and cancellation of a registration granted by the
                central government in case of a contravention of the terms of
                the registrations, the FCRA, or in the larger public interest.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. A contravention of the FCRA is punishable with imprisonment
                of up to 5 years, or a fine, or both. Where the offender is a
                company, persons such as directors and other managerial
                personnel may be held liable for the offence.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 is a relatively recent piece
                of legislation which provides for the establishment of
                corruption ombudsmen (called 'Lokpal' at the central level and
                'Lok Ayuktas' at the state level), which act independently from
                the executive branch of the government. These bodies have been
                empowered to investigate allegations of corruption against
                public functionaries, including offences under the PCA
                (including allegations against the prime minister and other
                central ministers, members of parliament and other public
                servants). Further, public servants are required to declare the
                assets held by them (together with their spouse and dependent
                children) on an annual basis. In March 2019, a former Supreme
                Court judge, Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose, was appointed as the
                country's first Lokpal, thus giving much-needed teeth to the
                anti-corruption legislation.

            <h3><u>Companies Act, 2013</u></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                1. The Companies Act, 2013 ('Companies Act') is India's law
                governing companies, and places a strong emphasis on corporate
                governance and the prevention of corporate fraud. Under the
                Companies Act, auditors and cost accountants are mandatorily
                required to report any suspected frauds (above a specified
                threshold) to the central government. Certain types of companies
                are also mandated to establish a vigilance mechanism for the
                reporting of concerns.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. The Companies Act defines the term 'fraud' quite broadly, and
                this could encompass acts of private or commercial bribery.
                Fraud is a criminal offence under the Companies Act and is
                punishable with imprisonment ranging from six months to 10 years
                and/or a fine. The Companies Act also obligates directors and
                senior management to maintain systems for ensuring compliance
                with applicable law, as well as accuracy of the books, records
                and financial statements of the company. Contravention of such
                provisions is punishable with fines (which depend upon the
                quantum of the amount involved in the fraud) and imprisonment.

                This enactment levies penal rates of tax on any undisclosed
                asset or income held abroad by a person resident in India and
                penalises individuals for non-disclosure of foreign income or
                assets, wilful attempt to evade tax, failure to furnish
                requisite returns, etc. The objective of the Act is to target
                undisclosed income and assets (potentially derived through
                illegal means, including corruption) which have been 'stashed'
                offshore by resident Indians.

            <h3><u>Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018</u></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In order to prevent offenders accused of economic offences from
                evading prosecution within the country, the Fugitive Economic
                Offenders Act, 2018 ('FEOA') was enacted on July 31, 2018. The
                FEOA targets fugitive economic offenders against whom an arrest
                warrant has been issued for certain predicate economic offences
                involving INR 100 crores and who have either left the country to
                avoid criminal prosecution or are abroad and refuse to return to
                face criminal prosecution. Predicate offences under the FEOA
                cover cheating and counterfeiting under the Indian Penal Code,
                1860, offences under the PCA and PMLA, corporate fraud under the
                Companies Act, benami transactions and tax evasion. The strength
                of the FEOA lies in its far-reacing measure of immediate
                confiscation of all properties of any abscondee, which acts as a
                strong deterrent against any desertion from the country.
